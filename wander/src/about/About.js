            Wander: A Guide to Exploring Seattle is a capstone project developed to use the power of food
            to tell the story around Seattleâ€™s International District. As land prices rise and gentrification
            becomes more prominant in areas around Seattle, locals are more likely to be priced out of the communities
            that have supported them for many years. We hope that users of this guide will be inspired to make a
            conscious effort to learn more about the  history of the International District in an effort to preserve and protect our community.
